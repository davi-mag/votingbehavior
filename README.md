Replication Package for Analysis of Voting Behavior in Italy in Python

This Notebook was produced by Irene Cozzi, Laura Guarnaschelli, Davide Magliano e Alessia Vanzella. Its aim is to replicate the analysis presented in the Sciences Po class on "Python andd Machine Learning" on the Voting behavior in Italy, titled "Voting Behavior in Italya: A Comprehensive Analysis and Efficient Prediction".

The Notebook requires the csv data from the European Social Survey wave 11 (named ESS11.csv), publicly available at https://ess.sikt.no/en/datafile/242aaa39-3bbb-40f5-98bf-bfb1ce53d8ef. At the same url it is possible to have access to the related codebook. Both files are also available in this repository (.csv in zipped file).

The Notebook is structured in the following sections:
1. Data Wrangling.
2. Summary Statistics.
3. Univariate and Bivariate Analysis.
4. Machine Learning and Regression Analysis (Decision Tree, Random Forests, Boosting, Multinomial Linear Regression)

A dedicate paper is available, with Literature Review, summary of the methodology, main results, interpretations and conclusions. For the comprehensive analysis, we invite you to explore the full notebook available here.
