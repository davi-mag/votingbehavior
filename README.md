Its aim is to replicate the analysis presented in the Sciences Po class on "Python andd Machine Learning" on the Voting behavior in Italy, titled "Voting Behavior in Italya: A Comprehensive Analysis and Efficient Prediction". \\

The Notebook requires the csv data from the European Social Survey wave 11 (named ESS11.csv), publicly available at https://ess.sikt.no/en/datafile/242aaa39-3bbb-40f5-98bf-bfb1ce53d8ef. At the same url it is possible to have access to the related codebook. \\

The Notebook is structured in the following sections:
1. Data Wrangling.
2. Summary Statistics.
3. Univariate and Bivariate Analysis.
